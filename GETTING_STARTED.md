## 🚀 How to Use (Quick Start)

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd /Users/vandanchopra/Vandan_Personal_Folder/CODE_STUFF/Projects/property-sms-sender
source venv/bin/activate
pip install requests
```

### 2. Prepare Google Drive File

1. Upload image/PDF to Google Drive
2. Right-click → Get link → Set to "Anyone with the link can view"
3. Copy the URL (e.g., `https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ABC123xyz/view`)

### 3. Update Google Sheet

Open: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LuOaHtPoJ_FOKPoVLSfLU8pkUeOHt2dOFGBvyJoxnFg/edit?gid=53157339#gid=53157339

In the **Message to Send** column, format like this:

```
Hi {first_name},

Here are the property details you requested!

Attachments: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/YOUR_FILE_ID/view]
```

**For multiple files:**
```
Property brochures attached.

Attachments: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/FILE1/view, https://drive.google.com/file/d/FILE2/view]
```

### 4. Test Mode (RECOMMENDED for first test)

```bash
cd whatsapp-agent
python digital_greens_followup.py --test
```

This will:
- ✅ Skip business hours check
- ✅ Ask for confirmation before sending each message
- ✅ Let you verify attachments are working

### 5. Production Mode

Once tested, run normally:
```bash
python run_whatsapp_campaigns.py
```

Or run individual campaigns:
```bash
cd whatsapp-agent
python digital_greens_followup.py
python Godrej_aristrocrat_followup.py
```

## 📝 Message Format Examples

### Example 1: Single Image
```
Hi John!

Here's the floor plan you requested.

Attachments: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ABC123/view]
```

### Example 2: Multiple Files (Image + PDF)
```
Hi Sarah!

Property brochures for Digital Greens attached below. Let me know if you have questions!

Attachments: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/IMAGE1/view, https://drive.google.com/file/d/BROCHURE/view]
```

### Example 3: Text Only (No Attachments)
```
Hi Mike!

Just following up on our conversation about the property. Are you still interested?
```

## 🎯 What Happens When You Send

1. **Parse**: System extracts attachment URLs from message
2. **Cache Check**: Looks for file in local cache
3. **Download**: If not cached, downloads from Google Drive (saved to `gdrive_cache/`)
4. **Attach**: Clicks WhatsApp attach button and selects files
5. **Type**: Types the message (without the "Attachments:" line)
6. **Send**: Sends everything together
7. **Update Sheet**: Saves clean message to Google Sheets

## 💾 Caching System

- **Location**: `whatsapp-agent/gdrive_cache/`
- **How it works**: First time = download (5-20 seconds), Next times = instant (cached)
- **Clear cache**: `rm -rf whatsapp-agent/gdrive_cache/*`

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "requests module not found"
```bash
pip install requests
```

### Attachments not sending
1. Check Google Drive link is publicly accessible
2. Verify format: `Attachments: [url1, url2]`
3. Check logs in `logs/campaigns_YYYYMMDD.log`

### Want to test without sending
```bash
python test_attachments.py
```

## 🎨 New Features from Remote (Bonus!)

The remote branch had improvements that we merged in:

1. **Better Logging**: Now uses emojis (📊 📱 ✅ ❌) for clearer output
2. **Debug Logger**: Detailed logs saved to `/tmp/whatsapp_debug.log`
3. **Test Mode Flags**: `--test` and `--force` flags for easier testing
4. **Retry Logic**: Automatic retries for failed messages

## 📊 Git Status

```
✅ Local changes: Committed
✅ Remote changes: Merged
✅ Conflicts: Resolved
✅ Pushed to GitHub: YES
✅ Branch: main
✅ Status: Up to date with origin/main
```

## 🎓 Next Steps

1. **Test with real Google Drive image**:
   - Upload a small image to your Google Drive
   - Get the shareable link
   - Add to Google Sheets message
   - Run: `python digital_greens_followup.py --test`

2. **Verify caching works**:
   - Send same message twice
   - First time: Downloads file (~10s)
   - Second time: Uses cache (~instant)

3. **Check logs**:
   - Main logs: `logs/campaigns_YYYYMMDD.log`
   - Debug logs: `/tmp/whatsapp_debug.log`
